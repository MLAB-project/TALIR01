# satplan

`satplan` searches for upcoming satellite passes and, optionally, produces a dishp tracking script which contains the pass trajectory.

Supplying the script to `dishp` will cause the dish to track the satellite pass in the sky. The script will first move the dish into waiting position at the beginning of the pass trajectory, then wait for the pass to start, then track the satellite in the sky and, after the pass is over, move the dish into the home position (0, 0).


```
$ ./satplan.py --help
usage: satplan.py [-h] [--satname SAT] [-n NO] [--dishp] [SINCE]

Search for satellite passes and prepare dishp tracking scripts. Times are UTC.
Location is hardcoded to SvÃ¡kov observatory.

positional arguments:
  SINCE          point in time at which to start searching for a satellite
                 pass (default: now)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --satname SAT  name of satellite of interest (default: 2019-038AE)
  -n NO          number of upcoming passes to list (default: 5)
  --dishp        export a dishp tracking script for the first upcoming pass,
                 redirect stdout to save to a file

$ ./satplan.py
Next 5 passes of sat '2019-038AE':

## Bugs

 * Passes are searched for by sampling the sat's altitude and azimuth once per minute into the future, starting with now and iteratively adding 1 minute. This causes the found start and end time and max ele to fluctuate.
